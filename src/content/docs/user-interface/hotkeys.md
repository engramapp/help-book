title: Hotkeys
---

Engram allows you to customize hotkeys, also known as keyboard shortcuts.

:::note
Hotkey modification is currently only available on desktop platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux).
:::

Hotkeys definitions are viewable and editable in the settings or in the `hotkeys.json` file within your applications data directory. (see: [File Locations](/))

Setting Hotkeys
---
To add a hotkey, remove a hotkey, or restore hotkeys to default, go to Settings → Hotkeys.

**Note for non-US users**: Even if the hotkey you type doesn't match on screen with what you would expect to see (given your keyboard layout), it will work fine following the actual buttons you pressed (as long as you don’t change layout).

The hotkey that appears on screen is the one that you would have to perform if you were using a US keyboard.

Hotkey Groups
---
Hotkeys are separated into 3 groups so the same hotkeys can perform different actions based on the current context.

1. General
2. Review
3. Wizard

Only when creating a card are the Wizard hotkeys enabled.

Only when reviewing a card are the Review hotkeys enabled.
