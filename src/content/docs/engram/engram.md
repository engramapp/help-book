# What is Engram

Engram is an intelligent flashcard platform that adapts to the way you memorize information *in any subject*.

The power lies behind [spaced-repetition](/), which works to combat the [forgetting-curve](/).

Engram manages spaced-repetition for you, by showing you information at increasing intervals using a science-backed algorithm, known as FSRS.

# How we're different

All core features of the application can be used for free and without an internet connection. 

Syncing is only a utility to facilitate working on multiple devices, the data will always primarily be stored on your device.


### Simple and Effective

Engram is designed with a focus on **simplicity**, **depth**, and **personalization** while offering ways to join friends taking similar journeys.

We simplify a complex system by abstraction, encouraging you to focus on learning and for the system to adapt to you. 

Additionally, markdown formatting enables creating rich, beautiful cards with speed, depth and ease.

### Your notes are first-class citizens

We believe your knowledge-management solutions should be kept separated, but *deeply integrated* into your memory-management solutions.

Engram reinforces this through its [Wiki-link](/cards/linking-notes) system, which opens up notes in your preferred platform.

We currently offer support these note-taking platforms:
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)

Additionally, your notes can be [rapidly imported into cards](/import/import-notes) using our note-search tool.

### Stay motivated

We make it easy to form a habit of learning with game-like features, fun challenges, reminders and beautiful progress visuals.


### For your brain

Engram offers a high-level of customization right out of the box, but users can create [themes](/extending-engram/themes) and [plugins](/extending-engram/community-plugins) that manipulate how the entire application looks and feels.
