Formatting text

Engram supports Markdown syntax to make text bold, italic, and add links and headings.

Copy and paste the following text in the front, back or context of a card:

    # Solidify your thinking.

The hash symbol (#) turns a line of text into a heading.

In your card, select any text and press Ctrl+B (or Cmd+B on macOS) to make it bold.
