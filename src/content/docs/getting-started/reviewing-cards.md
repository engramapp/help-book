title: Reviewing cards
---

Engram utilizes [FSRS](https://github.com/open-spaced-repetition) to automatically manage when you need to review cards based on your performance on previous reviews.

When reviewing a card, by default you are given 4 options to rate your performance.
- <span class="answer-again">Again</span>
- <span class="answer-hard">Hard</span>
- <span class="answer-good">Good</span>
- <span class="answer-easy">Easy</span>

Under each option is a general *estimation* on the next time that card will be due.

:::note
Cards are only available for review when they are due.

The speed you learn with Engram will depend mostly on the way the card is formed.

Engram works best when:
1. You completely understand the information on the card.
2. A card is broken down to focus on a **single idea**.
3. Cards are reviewed when they are due.
