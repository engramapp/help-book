title: Linking Notes
---

Engram borrows Obsidian's [Wiki-link](https://help.obsidian.md/Getting+started/Link+notes) feature to easily create deep-connections between cards and your notes.

To create a link:
- In either the **Front**, **Back** or **Context** of a note, hit the `[` key twice on your keyboard.
- Type the first few letters of a note.
- Press `Enter` on your keyboard.

**This feature must first be enabled.**

## Enable Markdown Linking

To enable this feature:
- Open the settings with ` or by clicking the gear icon.
- Select the **Import/Export** tab.
- Click the toggle to enable Markdown Import
- Click the `Manage` button next to "Markdown Folder Path".
- Copy and paste an **absolute** path to a specified directory.

Please visit [Importing Notes and Files](/import/import-notes) for more information.

Link to a note using an alias
---
To link to a note using an alias:
- Start typing the alias in an internal link. Any alias shows up in the list of suggestions, with a curved arrow icon next to it.
- Press Enter to select the alias.

Engram creates the link with the alias as its custom display text, for example `[[Artificial Intelligence|AI]]`.

:::note
Rather than just using the alias as the link destination (`[[AI]]`), Engram uses the `[[Artificial Intelligence|AI]]` link format to ensure interoperability with other applications using the Wikilink format.
