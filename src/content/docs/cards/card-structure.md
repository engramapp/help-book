Cards in Engram are split by **Front**, **Back**, and **Context** fields for simplicity and depth.

- The **Front** is displayed as the first side of the card you will be shown, typically a question.
- The **Back** is displayed the back side of the card, typically an answer.
- The **Context** is for additional information on that card.

Engram's [themes](/extending-engram/themes) and [plugins](/extending-engram/community-plugins) can be used to further customize how text and cards are rendered.

Card Types
---
Engram currently supports 3 card types.

1. **Standard** - A standard front-to-back flashcard, that can also be reversed to automatically create 2 cards.
2. **Cloze** - A cloze deletion card, also referred to a "fill-in-the-blank" question.
3. **Mask** - A cloze deletion card but for images.
