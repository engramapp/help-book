The speed you learn with Engram will depend on the way the card is formed.

Engram works best when:
1. You completely understand the information on the card.
2. A card is broken down to focus on a **single idea**.
3. Cards are reviewed when they are due.

[Callouts](/cards/callouts/) and the card [Context](/cards/card-structure/) can be used to give yourself hints and provide greater depth to your cards.

LLM Assistance

Engram allows users to connect the Card Wizard to a supported LLM provider to give suggestions that help craft the card to follow [Dr. Piotr Wozniak's 20 Rules of Formulating Knowledge](https://www.supermemo.com/en/blog/twenty-rules-of-formulating-knowledge). 

You can view or change the prompt being sent within the `suggestion_prompt` file in the application's data directory.
