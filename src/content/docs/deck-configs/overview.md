A **Deck Configuration** is a set of options that control how a deck of cards is reviewed.

Engram allows you to share configurations between different decks, to make it easier to update options in many decks at once. If you change an option in a config, the change is applied to all decks that use the same config. All newly created decks use the "Default" config.

:::caution[Deck options are not retroactive]
Changing an option in a config will not change the delay of previously reviewed cards.
